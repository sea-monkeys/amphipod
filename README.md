# AmphiPod ü¶ê

AmphiPod is a lightweight, HTTP-based **Model Context Protocol** (MCP) server implementation written in Go. It simplifies the integration of AI tools by providing an HTTP interface to the MCP specification and executing tools through WebAssembly plugins.

## üåü Key Features

- **HTTP-Based MCP Server**: Implements Anthropic's MCP specification using HTTP, making it accessible from any programming language
- **WebAssembly Tool Execution**: Leverages the Extism Framework for running tool plugins in WebAssembly
- **Language Agnostic**: Can be used with any programming language that supports HTTP requests
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Written in Go for optimal performance
- **Easy Integration**: Simple HTTP API for tool registration and execution

## üéØ Why AmphiPod?

While Anthropic's MCP specification is excellent, it requires implementing MCP clients in each programming language. Currently, official SDKs are only available for Python, TypeScript, and Kotlin. AmphiPod solves this limitation by:

1. Using HTTP as the transport protocol, enabling any language with HTTP capabilities to interact with the MCP server
2. Simplifying the integration process for host AI applications
3. Providing a consistent interface across different programming languages
4. Executing tools through WebAssembly plugins for enhanced security and portability

### Installation

### Basic Usage

## üîß API Endpoints

- `GET /tools/list`: Get available tools
- `POST /tools/call`: Execute a tool

## üì¶ Tool Development

AmphiPod uses **WebAssembly** plugins powered by the [**Extism** Framework](https://extism.org/). 

Look at the `./functions` directory for examples of WebAssembly plugins.

    class GenAI client;
    class ServerA,ServerB,ServerC server;
    class ResourceA,ResourceB resource;
    class ServiceC remote;
```

## üîÑ Workflow Overview

The MCP Client will be a simple HTTP client run by the Host GenAI application. The MCP Client will make HTTP requests to the MCP Server to get the list of tools and to make tool calls. The MCP Server will respond with the list of tools and the output of the tool calls.

    Host->>Host: Convert JSON to tools list
    Host->>Host: Generate LLM prompt
    Host->>LLM: Send prompt
    LLM-->>Host: Generate tool response
    
    Host->>Client: Send tool call request
    Client->>Server: POST /tools/call
    Server-->>Client: Return tool output
    Client-->>Host: Return tool response
```
