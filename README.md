# AmphiPod ü¶ê

AmphiPod is a lightweight, HTTP-based **Model Context Protocol** (MCP) server implementation written in Go. It simplifies the integration of AI tools by providing an HTTP interface to the MCP specification and executing tools through WebAssembly plugins.

## üåü Key Features

- **HTTP-Based MCP Server**: Implements Anthropic's MCP specification using HTTP, making it accessible from any programming language
- **WebAssembly Tool Execution**: Leverages the Extism Framework for running tool plugins in WebAssembly
- **Language Agnostic**: Can be used with any programming language that supports HTTP requests
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Written in Go for optimal performance
- **Easy Integration**: Simple HTTP API for tool registration and execution

## üéØ Why AmphiPod?

While Anthropic's MCP specification is excellent, it requires implementing MCP clients in each programming language. Currently, official SDKs are only available for Python, TypeScript, and Kotlin. AmphiPod solves this limitation by:

1. Using HTTP as the transport protocol, enabling any language with HTTP capabilities to interact with the MCP server
2. Simplifying the integration process for host AI applications
3. Providing a consistent interface across different programming languages
4. Executing tools through WebAssembly plugins for enhanced security and portability

## üîß API Endpoints

- `GET /tools/list`: Get available tools
- `POST /tools/call`: Execute a tool

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Start the MCP Server

```bash
go run main.go
```

#### Configuration for HTTPS and Authentication token (optional)

```bash
export HTTP_PORT=8080                      # Port to listen on
export USE_HTTPS=true                      # Enable HTTPS
export CERT_FILE=mcp.amphipod.local.crt    # Path to SSL certificate
export KEY_FILE=mcp.amphipod.local.key     # Path to SSL private key
export AUTH_TOKEN=shrimpsarebeautiful      # Authentication token
export REQUIRE_AUTH=true                   # Enable authentication
go run main.go
```

##### Generate a self-signed certificate

You can use mkcert to generate a self-signed certificate for development purposes:

```bash
mkcert \
-cert-file mcp.amphipod.local.crt \
-key-file mcp.amphipod.local.key \
amphipod.local "*.amphipod.local" localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

Then add the following line to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```bash
0.0.0.0 mcp.amphipod.local
```

## Tools

The tools are WebAssembly plugins. The tools are loaded by the MCP server and executed when called by the host application.

The list of tools is defined in the `./tools/mcp.list.json` file. The wasm plugin are loaded from the `./functions` directory.

### Test the MCP Server endpoints

You can simply use `curl` to test the MCP server endpoints.

#### List available tools

```bash
SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:8080"

curl --no-buffer ${SERVICE_URL}/tools/list 
```

#### Call a tool(s)

```bash
SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:8080"

read -r -d '' DATA <<- EOM
{
  "name":"say_hello",
  "arguments": {
    "name":"John Doe"
  }
}
EOM

curl --no-buffer ${SERVICE_URL}/tools/call \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "${DATA}" 
```

```bash
SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:8080"

read -r -d '' DATA <<- EOM
{
  "name":"say_goodbye",
  "arguments": {
    "name":"Jane Doe"
  }
}
EOM

curl --no-buffer ${SERVICE_URL}/tools/call \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "${DATA}" 
```

```bash
SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:8080"

read -r -d '' DATA <<- EOM
{
  "name":"add_numbers",
  "arguments": {
    "number1":28,
    "number2":14
  }
}
EOM

curl --no-buffer ${SERVICE_URL}/tools/call \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "${DATA}" 
```

### Tests with HTTPS and Authentication token

If you have enabled HTTPS and authentication token, you can test the endpoints with `curl` as follows:

#### List available tools

```bash
SERVICE_URL="https://mcp.amphipod.local:8080"

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer shrimpsarebeautiful" --no-buffer ${SERVICE_URL}/tools/list 
```
> where `shrimpsarebeautiful` is the authentication token

#### Call a tool(s)

```bash
SERVICE_URL="https://mcp.amphipod.local:8080"

read -r -d '' DATA <<- EOM
{
  "name":"say_hello",
  "arguments": {
    "name":"John Doe"
  }
}
EOM

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer shrimpsarebeautiful" --no-buffer ${SERVICE_URL}/tools/call \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "${DATA}" 
```


## üì¶ Tool Development

AmphiPod uses **WebAssembly** plugins powered by the [**Extism** Framework](https://extism.org/). 

Look at the `./functions` directory for examples of WebAssembly plugins.

    class ServerA,ServerB,ServerC server;
    class ResourceA,ResourceB resource;
    class ServiceC remote;
```

## üîÑ Workflow Overview

The MCP Client will be a simple HTTP client run by the Host GenAI application. The MCP Client will make HTTP requests to the MCP Server to get the list of tools and to make tool calls. The MCP Server will respond with the list of tools and the output of the tool calls.

    participant Client as MCP Client
    participant Server as MCP Server

    Host->>Client: Initialize HTTP Client
    Client->>Server: GET /tools/list
    Server-->>Client: Return tools JSON
    Client-->>Host: Return tools list
    
    Host->>Host: Convert JSON to tools list
    Host->>Host: Generate LLM prompt
    Host->>LLM: Send prompt
    LLM-->>Host: Generate tool response
    
    Host->>Client: Send tool call request
    Client->>Server: POST /tools/call
    Server-->>Client: Return tool output
    Client-->>Host: Return tool response
```

## MCP Host GenAI Application development

The Host GenAI application will be developed in the programming language of your choice. The Host GenAI application will use HTTP request to interact with the MCP Server.

Look at the `./samples` directory for examples of Host GenAI applications.
